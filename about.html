      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Melox Construction was incorporated in 2012 and began operations in 2014.
        With over 350 projects completed across South Africa and the SADC region,
        we’ve worked in areas like Waterfall, Eye of Africa, Irene of Pretoria,
        Zimbali Durban, and Ballito. Our mission is to uplift rural communities,
        create jobs, and make Africa a more comfortable place to live.
        We’ve proudly partnered with Plascon for over 10 years.
